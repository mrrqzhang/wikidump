v0.4.1
------

`Released July 30, 2015 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.4.1>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.4...v0.4.1>`__):

- The process for building Windows binaries has been fixed, and these should be
  distributed along with new releases. Windows users can now take advantage of
  C speedups without having a compiler of their own.
- Added support for Python 3.5.
- ``<`` and ``>`` are now disallowed in wikilink titles and template names.
  This includes when denoting tags, but not comments.
- Fixed the behavior of *preserve_spacing* in :meth:`.Template.add` and
  *keep_field* in :meth:`.Template.remove` on parameters with hidden keys.
- Removed :meth:`._ListProxy.detach`. :class:`.SmartList`\ s now use weak
  references and their children are garbage-collected properly.
- Fixed parser bugs involving:

  - templates with completely blank names;
  - templates with newlines and comments.

- Heavy refactoring and fixes to the C tokenizer, including:

  - corrected a design flaw in text handling, allowing for substantial speed
    improvements when parsing long strings of plain text;
  - implemented new Python 3.3
    `PEP 393 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/>`_ Unicode APIs.

- Fixed various bugs in :class:`.SmartList`, including one that was causing
  memory issues on 64-bit builds of Python 2 on Windows.
- Fixed some bugs in the release scripts.

v0.4
----

`Released May 23, 2015 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.4>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.3.3...v0.4>`__):

- The parser now falls back on pure Python mode if C extensions cannot be
  built. This fixes an issue that prevented some Windows users from installing
  the parser.
- Added support for parsing wikicode tables (patches by David Winegar).
- Added a script to test for memory leaks in :file:`scripts/memtest.py`.
- Added a script to do releases in :file:`scripts/release.sh`.
- *skip_style_tags* can now be passed to :func:`mwparserfromhell.parse()
  <.parse_anything>` (previously, only :meth:`.Parser.parse` allowed it).
- The *recursive* argument to :class:`Wikicode's <.Wikicode>` :meth:`.filter`
  methods now accepts a third option, ``RECURSE_OTHERS``, which recurses over
  all children except instances of *forcetype* (for example,
  ``code.filter_templates(code.RECURSE_OTHERS)`` returns all un-nested
  templates).
- The parser now understands HTML tag attributes quoted with single quotes.
  When setting a tag attribute's value, quotes will be added if necessary. As
  part of this, :class:`.Attribute`\ 's :attr:`~.Attribute.quoted` attribute
  has been changed to :attr:`~.Attribute.quotes`, and is now either a string or
  ``None``.
- Calling :meth:`.Template.remove` with a :class:`.Parameter` object that is
  not part of the template now raises :exc:`ValueError` instead of doing
  nothing.
- :class:`.Parameter`\ s with non-integer keys can no longer be created with
  *showkey=False*, nor have the value of this attribute be set to *False*
  later.
- :meth:`._ListProxy.destroy` has been changed to :meth:`._ListProxy.detach`,
  and now works in a more useful way.
- If something goes wrong while parsing, :exc:`.ParserError` will now be
  raised. Previously, the parser would produce an unclear :exc:`.BadRoute`
  exception or allow an incorrect node tree to be build.
- Fixed parser bugs involving:

  - nested tags;
  - comments in template names;
  - tags inside of ``<nowiki>`` tags.

- Added tests to ensure that parsed trees convert back to wikicode without
  unintentional modifications.
- Added support for a :envvar:`NOWEB` environment variable, which disables a
  unit test that makes a web call.
- Test coverage has been improved, and some minor related bugs have been fixed.
- Updated and fixed some documentation.

v0.3.3
------

`Released April 22, 2014 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.3.3>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3>`__):

- Added support for Python 2.6 and 3.4.
- :meth:`.Template.has` is now passed *ignore_empty=False* by default
  instead of *True*. This fixes a bug when adding parameters to templates with
  empty fields, **and is a breaking change if you rely on the default
  behavior.**
- The *matches* argument of :class:`Wikicode's <.Wikicode>` :meth:`.filter`
  methods now accepts a function (taking one argument, a :class:`.Node`, and
  returning a bool) in addition to a regex.
- Re-added *flat* argument to :meth:`.Wikicode.get_sections`, fixed the order
  in which it returns sections, and made it faster.
- :meth:`.Wikicode.matches` now accepts a tuple or list of
  strings/:class:`.Wikicode` objects instead of just a single string or
  :class:`.Wikicode`.
- Given the frequency of issues with the (admittedly insufficient) tag parser,
  there's a temporary *skip_style_tags* argument to :meth:`~.Parser.parse` that
  ignores ``''`` and ``'''`` until these issues are corrected.
- Fixed a parser bug involving nested wikilinks and external links.
- C code cleanup and speed improvements.

v0.3.2
------

`Released September 1, 2013 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.3.2>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2>`__):

- Added support for Python 3.2 (along with current support for 3.3 and 2.7).
- Renamed :meth:`.Template.remove`\ 's first argument from *name* to *param*,
  which now accepts :class:`.Parameter` objects in addition to parameter name
  strings.

v0.3.1
------

`Released August 29, 2013 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.3.1>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.3...v0.3.1>`__):

- Fixed a parser bug involving URLs nested inside other markup.
- Fixed some typos.

v0.3
----

`Released August 24, 2013 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.3>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.2...v0.3>`__):

- Added complete support for HTML :class:`Tags <.Tag>`, including forms like
  ``<ref>foo</ref>``, ``<ref name="bar"/>``, and wiki-markup tags like bold
  (``'''``), italics (``''``), and lists (``*``, ``#``, ``;`` and ``:``).
- Added support for :class:`.ExternalLink`\ s (``http://example.com/`` and
  ``[http://example.com/ Example]``).
- :class:`Wikicode's <.Wikicode>` :meth:`.filter` methods are now passed
  *recursive=True* by default instead of *False*. **This is a breaking change
  if you rely on any filter() methods being non-recursive by default.**
- Added a :meth:`.matches` method to :class:`.Wikicode` for page/template name
  comparisons.
- The *obj* param of :meth:`.Wikicode.insert_before`, :meth:`.insert_after`,
  :meth:`~.Wikicode.replace`, and :meth:`~.Wikicode.remove` now accepts
  :class:`.Wikicode` objects and strings representing parts of wikitext,
  instead of just nodes. These methods also make all possible substitutions
  instead of just one.
- Renamed :meth:`.Template.has_param` to :meth:`~.Template.has` for consistency
  with :class:`.Template`\ 's other methods; :meth:`.has_param` is now an
  alias.
- The C tokenizer extension now works on Python 3 in addition to Python 2.7.
- Various bugfixes, internal changes, and cleanup.

v0.2
----

`Released June 20, 2013 <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/tree/v0.2>`_
(`changes <https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2>`__):

- The parser now fully supports Python 3 in addition to Python 2.7.
- Added a C tokenizer extension that is significantly faster than its Python
  equivalent. It is enabled by default (if available) and can be toggled by
  setting :attr:`mwparserfromhell.parser.use_c` to a boolean value.
- Added a complete set of unit tests covering parsing and wikicode
  manipulation.
- Renamed :meth:`.filter_links` to :meth:`.filter_wikilinks` (applies to
  :meth:`.ifilter` as well).
- Added filter methods for :class:`Arguments <.Argument>`,
  :class:`Comments <.Comment>`, :class:`Headings <.Heading>`, and
  :class:`HTMLEntities <.HTMLEntity>`.
- Added *before* param to :meth:`.Template.add`; renamed *force_nonconformity*
  to *preserve_spacing*.
- Added *include_lead* param to :meth:`.Wikicode.get_sections`.
- Removed *flat* param from :meth:`.get_sections`.
- Removed *force_no_field* param from :meth:`.Template.remove`.
- Added support for Travis CI.
- Added note about Windows build issue in the README.
- The tokenizer will limit itself to a realistic recursion depth to prevent
  errors and unreasonably long parse times.
- Fixed how some nodes' attribute setters handle input.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the tokenizer's handling of invalid markup.
- Fixed bugs in the implementation of :class:`.SmartList` and
  :class:`.StringMixIn`.
- Fixed some broken example code in the README; other copyedits.
- Other bugfixes and code cleanup.
